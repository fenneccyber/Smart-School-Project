# Smart School Infrastructure Management System

## Project Overview
This is a web-based application designed to manage and monitor school infrastructure. The system will provide a real-time overview of school facilities, track maintenance for critical systems (such as solar energy and water supply), and offer a user-friendly interface for administrators, students, and maintenance teams.

## Core Features
### 1. 3D School Information Showcase
A 3D interactive map/model of the school that visualizes:
- Classrooms, offices, laboratories, and common areas.
- Essential systems like electricity, water supply, solar energy panels, and HVAC.

Clickable features allowing users to see:
- Room details (purpose, capacity, available resources).
- Status of key infrastructure (solar panel output, water leakage detection, etc.).

### 2. Smart Maintenance System
Automated Issue Detection:
- Integration with IoT sensors or manual input for issues like:
    - Water leaks, electrical failures, and solar system inefficiencies.
- Sensors send real-time alerts to administrators and maintenance teams.

Maintenance Request Platform:
- Staff and students can report issues via the website.
- Track ongoing repairs and their status.

### 3. User Platforms & Interfaces
#### A. Administrative Dashboard (For School Management & Maintenance Team)
- View school status in real time (3D model, alerts, reports).
- Manage and assign maintenance tasks with priority levels.
- Monitor energy usage and system health for solar and electrical systems.
- Generate reports on repairs, costs, and infrastructure health.

#### B. Student & Staff Portal
- View school information (class schedules, announcements, event updates).
- Report infrastructure issues via an easy-to-use form.
- Track reported issues and updates from the maintenance team.

## Technical Details
### Technology Stack
#### Frontend (Client-Side)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For a responsive and interactive UI.
- **Three.js**: For rendering the 3D school model.
- **Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS**: For modern, responsive styling.

#### Backend (Server-Side)
- **Node.js + Express.js**: To handle user requests and database interactions.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MySQL (to store school data, maintenance records, and user reports).

#### IoT & Sensors (Optional, Future Phase):
- **MQTT or WebSockets**: To handle real-time updates from IoT sensors.

#### Hosting & Deployment:
- Hosted on school servers or cloud-based solutions (VPS, AWS, or Firebase).

## Development Phases
### Phase 1 - Basic Prototype (MVP)
- Develop a simple frontend prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
    - Basic navigation menu.
    - Static 3D school model using Three.js (with dummy data).
    - User interface for admin dashboard & maintenance request system.
- Set up a Node.js backend:
    - Create an API to store and retrieve maintenance requests.

### Phase 2 - Advanced Functionality
- Connect the frontend to a real database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
- Implement user authentication (Admin, Students, Maintenance Team).
- Improve issue reporting system (file uploads, status tracking).

### Phase 3 - IoT Integration & Real-time Updates
- Integrate IoT sensors for real-time maintenance tracking.
- Enable automated alerts & maintenance scheduling.
